# MuscleMetric Pro

MuscleMetric Pro is a revolutionary physical therapy solution that leverages cutting-edge technology to enhance rehabilitation outcomes. By integrating Force-Sensitive Resistors (FSRs), Bluetooth connectivity, PyQT5 framework, SQLite database, and a gyroscope, MuscleMetric Pro offers unprecedented insights into patient progress and exercise performance.

## Technologies Used:

- **Force-Sensitive Resistors (FSRs):** Captures muscle force data during exercises.
- **Bluetooth Module (HC-05):** Enables wireless connectivity for real-time data transmission.
- **PyQT5 Framework:** Develops an intuitive and user-friendly desktop application interface.
- **SQLite Database:** Stores patient data securely for comprehensive analysis.
- **Accelerometer, Gyroscope:** Measures joint range of motion for precise exercise assessment.

## Features:

- Accurate measurement of muscle force during exercises.
- Real-time data transmission via Bluetooth for remote monitoring.
- Intuitive desktop application interface for therapists.
- Secure storage and analysis of patient data.
- Assessment of joint range of motion using gyroscope technology.
